/*
 - Declaring Variables:
    - In Swift, variables are declared using the 'var' keyword.
    - Unlike most strongly-typed languages, you do not need a ';' after declaring your variables.
    - Variables cannot be used before being initialized.
    - Variable types must be implicited or explicited specified, meaning, variables either have to be assigned
      a value to specify its type or explicitly specify its type upon declaration. */

/* Declaring a variable called 'message' and implicitly specifying its type as a String */

var message = "Hello World!"

/* Declaring a variable called 'maximumPlayerHealth' and explicitly specifying its type as an Integer */
 
var maximumPlayerHealth : Int

/* Declaring multiple integer variables */

var midtermGrade, finalExamGrade, assignmentGrade, LabGrade : Int
