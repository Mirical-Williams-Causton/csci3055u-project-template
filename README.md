## About the language

#### History of the Language
Swift is Apple's programming language used for the development of macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. It is a general-purpose programming language built using a modern approach to safety, performance, and software design patterns (Apple 2018). It first went into development in July 2010 by Chris Lattner, with Chris later soughting the help of other Apple programmers during the course of its development. It was released to Apple's registered developers during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June 2014. With Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference appication being the first publicly released application programmed entirely in Swift. It was later publicly released in September 2014, being originally closed source at launch. Later becoming open source under the Apache 2.0 license with a Runtime Library Exception in March 2016.

#### Features
- Closures unified with function pointers
- Tuples and multiple return values
- Generics
- Fast and concise iteration over a range or collection
- Structs that support methods, extensions, and protocols
- Functional programming patterns such as maps and filters
- Powerful error handling built-in
- Advanced control flow with do, guard, and repeat keywords

## About the syntax

*For-In Loops*
```swift
var numbers : Array <Int> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for i in numbers {
  print(i)
}
```

## About the tools

> _Describe the compiler or interpreter needed_.

## About the standard library

> _Give some examples of the functions and data structures
> offered by the standard library_.

## About open source library

> _Describe at least one contribution by the open source
community written in the language._

# Analysis of the language

> _Organize your report according to the project description
document_.
